# Basic-Smart-Home-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer project simulating a basic smart home network setup. It utilizes AAA protocols for access control, offering both local and server-based authentication methods.

The network includes:

Server: Manages data, services, and resources.
Router: Directs data packets between networks.
Switch (2950-24): Provides Ethernet connectivity for small to medium-sized businesses.
Wireless Router (WRT300N): Offers wireless internet access with security features like WPA/WPA2 encryption and MAC address filtering.

Explore the simulation to understand access control mechanisms and network device functionalities.
